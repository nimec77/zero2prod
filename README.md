### How this README was assembled  

* Directory structure, language percentages and absence of an existing description were inspected directly from the repo’s public listing on GitHub.  
* Build commands, scripts and runtime ports follow the conventions laid out in the _Zero‑to‑Production_ book and its reference implementation.  
* Sections and badges are intentionally minimal – adjust wording or add shields (CI, crates‑io, coverage) once those pipelines are in place.

Feel free to tweak tone or depth before committing.
