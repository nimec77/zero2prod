# Memory Bank Usage Rules

This directory contains files and subdirectories used by the AI assistant to store and manage project memory, context, and knowledge. Follow these conventions for reading, updating, and archiving information:

## File Conventions

- **activeContext.md**: Contains the current focus, blockers, and immediate context for ongoing work. Update this file as the project's focus changes.
- **tasks.md**: Tracks tasks in three sections: To Do, In Progress, and Done. Update as tasks move through stages.
- **progress.md**: Log significant project events, milestones, or decisions. Add dated entries for traceability.
- **projectbrief.md**: High-level project summary, goals, and scope. Update only if the project's direction changes.
- **productContext.md**: User stories and product requirements. Update as requirements evolve.
- **techContext.md**: Technical stack, integrations, and key technical decisions. Update as the tech stack or architecture changes.
- **systemPatterns.md**: Architectural and design patterns used in the project. Update if new patterns are adopted or changed.
- **style-guide.md**: Coding and documentation style conventions. Update if style rules change.

## Subdirectory Conventions

- **archive/**: Move outdated or superseded context files here for historical reference.
- **reflection/**: Store reflections, retrospectives, or lessons learned.
- **creative/**: Store creative ideas, brainstorming notes, or experimental concepts.

## General Rules

- Keep files concise and up-to-date.
- Use markdown formatting for clarity.
- Archive old context rather than deleting it.
- The AI assistant should reference these files to maintain continuity and context across sessions.
